## Introduction
Eva is a [gemini protocol](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) browser written in
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org) using the [gtk+](https://gtk-rs.org/) toolkit. Eva
is focused on delivering a simple yet powerful interface and clear, readable
and beautiful page rendering. It has no designs on being the most fully featured
Gemini browser, but instead wants to be the most polished native Gtk+ Gemini
client that stays out of the user's way.

Eva's gemtext rendering has been designed to be clean yet visually appealing,
using modern css styling to visually separate elements such as block quotes and
preformatted sections, using colored cards with rounded edges and box shadows.
The default color scheme has been chosen to provide great readability, while
giving the user a great deal of control over appearance.

Eva is currently alpha quality software and is under heavy development. Some
features are not yet implemented and there may be bugs. However, rest assured
that when Eva sees an official release it will be a polished user experience.
