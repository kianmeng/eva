## Defaults
As described in the project README, Eva comes with the following default
keybindings.
| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl/T | New tab |
| Ctrl/N | New window |
| Ctrl/W | Close tab |
| Ctrl/Q | Close window |
| Ctrl/R | Reload page |
| Alt/Home | Go to homepage |
| Alt/Left | Go back |
| Alt/Right | Go next |
| Ctrl/PageDown | Next tab |
| Ctrl/PageUp | Previous tab |
| Alt/[1-9] | nth tab |
| Ctrl/Shift/O | Open bookmarks |
| Ctrl/D | Bookmark page |
| Ctrl/H | Open History |
| Ctrl/Shift/P | Open preferences |
| Ctrl/Shift/A | Open about dialog |

It is possible to configure these keybindings to suit one's own needs by creating
a *keys.toml* file. The location of this file should be in the same directory as
the program's configuration file, usually in `~/.config/eva`. This file is in
[toml](https://toml.io/en/) format and consists of a simple key/value store.

### Sample *keys.toml* file
```
[keys]
go_previous = "<primary>B"
go_next = "<primary>F"
open_bookmarks = "<primary><Shift>B"
```
The first field is the action name, while the value is the key combination
consisting of one or more modifiers and a key value. If the action name is
misspelled or does not refer to a valid action it will be ignored, while if the
keybinding specified does not parse to a valid keybinding the program will fall
back to it's default for that action.

can be consulted for the full list, removing the "GDK_KEY_" portion of the string.
